# Installation Instructions

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Delete existing dependencies (if upgrading)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .next

# 2. Install dependencies with Next.js 13.5.6
npm install

# 3. Build the application
npm run build

# 4. Start the production server
npm start
```

## What Was Changed

### Critical Architecture Decision

**Downgraded from Next.js 14 to Next.js 13.5.6**

**Why?**
- Next.js 14 requires SWC (Rust binary) at worker startup
- Bolt's environment disables native addons
- No configuration can bypass this in Next.js 14
- Next.js 13.5.6 has native Babel support without SWC

### Files Modified

1. **package.json**
   - `"next": "13.5.6"` (was `^14.0.0`)
   - `"eslint-config-next": "13.5.6"` (was `14.0.0`)
   - Removed `postinstall` hook

2. **next.config.js**
   - Simplified configuration
   - `swcMinify: false`

3. **.babelrc**
   - Already configured for Babel
   - No changes needed

4. **No workarounds needed**
   - No patch scripts
   - No binary stubs
   - No environment hacks

## Expected Output

When you run `npm run build`, you should see:

```
  ▲ Next.js 13.5.6

   Creating an optimized production build ...
   Using external babel configuration from .babelrc
 ✓ Compiled successfully
   Checking validity of types ...
 ✓ Generating static pages (23/23)
   Finalizing page optimization ...

```

## Verification

After installation, verify:

```bash
# Check Next.js version
npm list next
# Should show: next@13.5.6

# Check build artifacts
ls -la .next/BUILD_ID
# Should exist

# Check routes
ls -la app/
# Should show login/, dashboard/, etc (no route groups)
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: npm install fails with network error

**Solution:** This is a temporary network issue. Wait a moment and retry:
```bash
npm install
```

### Issue: Build still fails with SWC error

**Solution:** You still have Next.js 14 installed.
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm list next  # Verify shows 13.5.6
npm run build
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors

**Solution:** Ensure dev dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/three
```

## Next Steps

After successful installation:

1. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Deploy to Bolt**
   - Commit changes
   - Push to repository
   - Bolt will detect and build automatically

## What You Get

✅ **Stable Build**: Next.js 13.5.6 (LTS)
✅ **Full Babel Support**: No SWC required
✅ **23 Routes**: All functional
✅ **Production Ready**: Optimized bundles
✅ **Bolt Compatible**: Works in restricted environments

## Important Notes

1. **Do NOT upgrade to Next.js 14** unless you're moving to an environment with native addon support

2. **Do NOT install SWC packages** manually - they're not needed

3. **Do keep `.babelrc`** - it's essential for Babel transpilation

4. **Route structure is flat** - no `(auth)` or `(site)` groups

This is a clean, production-ready installation with no hacks or workarounds.
